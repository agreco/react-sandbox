# React/JSX Sandbox with Gulp, Webpack and Mocha Chai
A React/JSX sandbox for hacking and testing React Apps with Gulp, Webpack and Mocha Chai

## Getting started
Run npm start from the command line to fire up a server, then navigate to http://localhost:8080

## Testing
Run npm test from the command line and watch the green. Ideally this can be done with Jest, but it proved to be very sluggish and clunky with newer versions of Node.

## TODO
Investing testing with Jest
