# React Sandbox with Gulp, Webpack and Mocha Chai
A React sandbox for hacking and testing React Apps with Gulp, Webpack and Mocha Chai

## Getting started
Run npm start from the command line to fire up a server, then navigate to http://localhost:8080

## TODO
Complete unit tests to be able to run npm test and have mocha run through its unit tests.
Ideally this can be done with Jest, and it has been added to the dep list for future use, but at this moment Jest is very sluggish and clunky with newer versions of Node.
